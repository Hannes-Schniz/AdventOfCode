# Advent fo code

This is an assortment of my solutions of the advent of code in different langauages.



## Python

To run the python solutions just run the tester.py 

You need to have two folders setup in the following way:

```
+ tester.py
+ 2025
| 2025-12-01_script.py
+ inputs
  | 2025-12-01_input.txt
+ tests
  | 2025-12-01_input.txt
```

You can then run the test or real input through the interactive prompts of the tester.
